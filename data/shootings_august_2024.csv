At the hospital, Malca assaulted several staff members of the Olive View Medical Center psychiatric emergency department with a metal broom handle . When Dall responded to the psychiatric emergency department to stop this attack, Malca advanced towards him with the metal broom handle and refused to drop it even when Dall pointed his service weapon at him. Malca continued his pattern of aggressive and dangerous conduct when he attempted to strike Moylan with the metal rod and stole Moylan’s patrol vehicle which contained a loaded shotgun and AR -15 rifle. Malc a increased the danger he posed when he subsequently led Dall, Moylan, and personnel from the LASD , the LAPD and CHP , on a high -speed chase which lasted approximatel y 40 minutes over congested highways and city streets. During the pursuit, Malca drove at high speeds, through numerous red lights and on the sidewalk there by placing many pedestrians and motorists in danger. In addition, at one point during the pursui t, Malca reversed the patrol vehicle he was driving into a marked LASD vehicle ; Malca subsequently drove within two to four feet of Sergeant Moylan . After observ ing Malca’s dangerous and escalating pattern of conduct, Sergeant Moylan reasonably feared tha t Malca would drive away and strike a pedestrian in the area. Moylan was 6 also reasonably afraid that Malca, who had already engaged in assaultive conduct towards several people including armed law enforcement officers, would gain access to the firearms in the patrol vehicle and use them . In fear, Moylan fired his service weapon two times and struck Malca in the left shoulder. Based on the escalating danger posed by Malca’s action , the evidence reviewed in the present case demonstrates that Sergeant Moylan acted in lawful self-defense and defense of another when he used deadly force to stop Malca.

Weathermon intentionally collided with the rear of Franc o’s vehicle so as to block Franco’s ability to reverse, re -position and flee. Weathermon exited his police vehicl e and ran up to Franco’s window with his service weapon pointed at Franco, in an attempt to stop Franco from continuing to drive in a manner that placed other innocent people or other police officers in danger of death or serious bodily injury. Upon reaching F ranco’s open window, Weathermon yelled, “Put your hands up!” Franco ignored Weathermon’s commands . Instead of complying, Franco looked down and to the right, and simultaneously reached under and alongside his seat with his right hand. Weathermon, who saw Franco’s movements and the vehicl e shaking violently, again yelled, “Get your fuckin’ hands up!” Franco refused to comply and continued to reach under and to the side of his seat with his right hand . Franco then began to accelerate quickly and steered the vehicle to the right. Based o n Weathermon ’s training and experience, he believed that Franco was reaching for a gun or other weapon . Weathermon feared for his life . In response, Weathermon fired his handgun twice in self-defense . We find that there is insufficient evidence to prov e beyond a reasonable doubt that Corporal Michael Weathermon was not acting in lawful self-defense when he used deadly force against Richard Franco .

The gunfire did not strike Campbell. Harris immediately stopped firing his service weapon when Campbell stopped driving in reverse . It wa s reasonable , under the totality of the circumstances, for Harris to fear imminent serious bodily injury or death when Campbell reversed his vehicle toward him. Although the Mustang reversed slowly, and for a short distance, Campbell’s behavior that day w as reckless, er ratic, and demo nstrated an unwillingness to surrender. It was reasonable for Harris to believe that the use of deadly force was necessary because it appeared that Campbell was not going to stop reversing until he struck him, and the other deputies. Campbell also acknowledged that it was reasonable for deputies to think he was going to strike them with his vehicle when he reversed toward them. He stated it was “ common sense.” Finally, Campbell pled nolo contendere to assaulting Har ris with his vehicle. 2.Second Officer Involved ShootingNorris fired four rounds at Campbell when the Mustang attempted to pass through a narrow gap of road at a high rate of speed, and where Norris was standing. One round shattered the driver window a nd struck Campbell ’s left hand. It appears from the ballistic evidence, that Norris was to the front of the Mustang when he fired that shot. Norris stopped firing as the passenger door passed him. 17 It was reasonable, under the totality of the circumstance s, for Norris to fear imminent serious bodily injury or death when Campbell accelerated his vehicle toward Norris. Campbell drove his vehicle recklessly when he fled from deputies earlier. He ran multiple stop signs and stop lights, drove on the wrong si de of the road and nearly collided with other vehicles. Campbell did not care that he endangered the lives of innocent motorists and pedestrians, as well as pursuing deputies. He simply wanted to escape. It was reasonable for Norris to conclude that he needed to stop Campbell before Campbell struck him and any other deputy in the area.

He did not attack any motorist s or pedestrian s. It appears from the totality of evidence that the purpose of Rusanovskiy ’s behavior was to get a police response to his location. Immediately upon the arrival of Pressler and Ponce, Rusanovskiy advanced toward the officers. He ignored multiple order s to drop the knife. Instead, Rusanovskiy let out a loud scream, raised the knife above his head and charged toward Pressler as the officer pointed hi s service weapon at Rusano vskiy .

File #021-00001-3199-013']","This incident occurred during a routine traffic stop. Both Alvarado and . initially cooperated during their initial detention. Even after Officer Puente located heroin inside the car and told Alvarado what he had found, Alvarado remained calm. However, once it became clear to Alvarado that Officer Puente was going to search the car’s trunk, Alvarado reacted violently, pushing Officer Puente to the ground and reaching into the trunk to search for an item. Officer Cortez and Officer Guillen, with weapons drawn and pointed at Alvarado, yelled at him to stop searching in the trunk. Officer Guillen believed Alvarado was reaching for a gun and attempted to pull Alvarado away from the vehicle, but Alvarado repeatedly broke away. An independent witness heard the officers yelling, “Get down, get out!” and telling [Alvarado] to stop what he was doing. Based on his observations, the witness believed [Alvarado] was trying to run away from the officers. Officers repeatedly ordered Alvarado to stop reaching and told him that they would shoot him if he continued searching inside the trunk. Alvarado broke away and grabbed the bag (containing the gun) and held it to his chest. Alvarado’s singular focus on the contents of the duffle bag and repeated attempts to gain control of the bag, support Officer Puente’s belief that Alvarado was searching for a gun. Officer Puente stated, “I feared that my officers were either gonna be shot at or I was gonna be shot at” based on Alvarado’s demeanor and the way that Alvarado “actively resisted [them] at gunpoint.” Officer Puente told investigators, that he believed the black object that fell from Alvarado’s duffle bag was a gun because Alvarado was willing to risk getting shot by the officers to gain possession of the bag. Officer Puente told investigators, “So, before [Alvarado] can pick up what I thought was a weapon and . . . then shoot us, that is when I took my first shot.” Officer Puente further stated that even after Alvarado had been shot, Alvarado said, “Fuck you!” and continued reaching for the black object, causing Puente to shoot again. Still fearing for his and the other officers’ safety, as Alvarado attempted to get up, Officer Puente fired a third time. Once the scene was secured and the officers were no longer in fear for their lives, the officers discovered the black object that Alvarado repeatedly attempted to access contained a loaded semi-automatic handgun. Although Officer Puente did not see Alvarado’s gun while Alvarado was fighting with Officer Guillen, it cannot be proved that Officer Puente’s stated fear that Alvarado was attempting to 19 arm himself and shoot the officers was unreasonable and that Officer Puente’s decision to use deadly force was not necessary. Based on the totality of the circumstances, it cannot be concluded that Officer Paul Puente acted unlawfully when he used deadly force against David Alvarado."

He deliberately changed directions when he observed the marke d patrol vehicle waiting in the center median. He maneuvered around slower traffic on Western Avenue as the patrol vehicle approached with its lights activated, striking a vehicle. Torosyan ignored multiple commands to show his hands and turn off the engine, accelerat ing away from the officers. Torosyan fle d from the patrol vehicle on the freeway, driving along the shoulder to pass heavy traffic. He finally came to stop after forcing his way back into traffic then exited in the middle of the freeway with a gun in his hand . By arming hi mself with a firearm upon exiting the Land Rover , Torosyan escalated the situation to a potentially deadly confrontation. Torosyan could have left the gun in the vehicle. Instead, he chose to take the weap on with him when he fled on foot . Torosyan’s behavior showed a desperation and willingness to do anything to escape. Under the circumstances, when Torosyan looked back toward Marx , it was reasonable for Marx to believe that Torosyan intended to use the weapon against him in an effort to stop his pursuit . Marx believed that he fired all four rounds when Torosyan was looking back at him. The BWV show s that the final round was fired when Torosyan was running from him. This fact does not change the analysis in this case. All four rounds were fired within three seconds , with a slight pause between the second and third shot. During that time, Torosyan maintained possession of the fire arm and still posed an immediate deadly threat. Finally, Marx did not fire any additional rounds once he believed that Torosyan no longer posed an immediate threat to him.

Instead of surrendering to the deputies, Ball turned toward Trevillyan with the gun pointed in his direction. 9 The fact that the weapon was a BB gun does not change the analysis in t his case.

Andy Ramirez’ actions placed the deputies in reasonable fear for their lives, and the lives of their fellow deputies, and they responded with reasonable deadly force. 11 The use of deadly force against Jorge Ramirez was also reasonable under the circumstances.

File #019 -00013 -3199 -057']","The evidence examined shows that Houx was acting with reasonable suspicion when he attempted to detain Canizales for unlawfully trespas sing on the train tracks . Houx was also acting within reason when he ordered Canizales to remove his hands from h is pockets for officer safety during his contact with him . Canizales ignored Houx’s lawful orders and fled from the officer. Eventually, Houx was joined by Sanchez and Reyes as they pursued Canizales. During the pursuit, Houx and Sanchez fired their service weapons, striking Canizales . Canizales was not armed with a firearm. Under the circumstances, there is insufficient evidence to prove that it was unreasonable for Houx and Sanchez to conclude that Canizales was armed with a firearm at the time of the shooting. Canizales repeatedly placed his hands in his sweatshirt pocket or front waistband area while fleeing from officers . When a person is running, they typically move their arms in a back and 15 forth motion . It is not normal for a person to keep one or both hands at their waist . The manner in which Canizales held his hands was consistent with someon e preventing an object from falling from a pocket or waist band . It is not uncommon for individuals to carry a firearm in a pocket or waistband in an effort to conceal it from the police. The officers ordered Canizales at least ten times to remove his hands and stop reaching as he was walking south on Paramount Boulevard. Canizales ignored them. Based on his behavior, it was not un reasonable for Houx and Sanchez to conclude that Canizales was concealing a gun from their view. It should also be noted that Canizales fled a sign ificant distance from the officers. His refusal to surrender is also consistent with a person in possession of an illegal firearm and attempting to escape the consequences. The s urveillance footage captures Canizales repeatedly moving his hands to and fr om his front pocket or waistband while t he officers point their firearms at him and order him to raise his hands. Canizales st ared straight ahe ad, continued walking and ignored their presence. Houx and Sanchez s tated that they fired their weapons when th ey saw Canizales turn the left side of his body while making a movement with his right hand consistent with pulling something from his right side. Believing that he was removing a firearm to shoot at them, they responded with deadly force. Reyes also feared that Canizales was about to fire at them, but was in the process of transitioning to a Taser and did not fire. The surveillance video shows Canizales veer slightly to the left moments before he falls. It does not capture what he is doing with his rig ht hand, as it is out of view. The surveillance footage does show that Canizales never raise d his hands above his head as described by Samantha H. Ultimately, it was determined that Canizales was unarmed. However, moments before the shooting, Canizales actions led Virginia M. to fear he was about to fire a gun when he extended his right arm toward Reyes in the rear parking lot. She fled, in fear for her life. Canizales had threatened to shoot Reyes wh en Canizales pointed his arm toward him. Reyes duck ed down in his patrol unit, convinced that he was about to be shot. At the time of the shooting, Houx and Sanchez had no way to know that Canizales was only “pretending” to be armed. The officers were forced to make a split -second decision in th e moment and based on the totality of Canizales’ behavior, there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Houx and Sanchez did not reasonably believe that Canizales posed a threat of se rious bodily harm or death and found it necessar y to respond with deadly force.

We have concluded the deputies acted in lawful self -defense and defense of a third party when they fired their weapons, reasonably believing, based on a totality of the circumstances, that deadly force was necessary to defend against a deadly threat. The District Attorney’s Command Center was notified of this shooting on June 23, 2021, at approxima tely 10:50 a.m. The District Attorney Response Team responded to the location. They were given a briefing and walk -through of the scene by LASD Lieutenant Brandon Dean. The following analysis is based on video footage, reports, recorded interviews, photogr aphs, medical records, and voluntary statements from Deputies Conger and Fierros. Deputy Rojas did not provide a voluntary statement. These materials were submitted to this office by the LASD Homicide Bureau. The involved deputies were not equipped with bo dy worn video (BWV). Only Deputy Conger’s patrol car was equipped with a dash camera. INTRODUCTION On June 23, 2021, at approximately 9:25 a.m., Holder stole a parked box truck from downtown Los Angeles. At 9:52 a.m., an LAPD airship reported to LASD that the truck was driving recklessly near the city of Norwalk.1 Multiple LASD units responded to the indicated location. When deputies attempted a traffic stop, Holder initially pulled over. Deputies commanded Holder to exit the truck. Holder ignored them and instead, after several minutes, abruptly drove 1 The airship officers and responding deputies were apparently unaware that the truck was stolen. This came to light after the incident, and investigators later recovered footage of Holder stealing the box truck after its owner parked it on the street and l eft it briefly unattended.1 away from the location at high speed. Holder traveled about one block through a residential neighborhood before getting stuck in traffic at a red light. While the truck sat at the red light, Deputies Conger, Fierros, an d Rojas walked toward it from behind. Fierros and Rojas approached the driver side door with their 9mm service pistols drawn as Conger approached the passenger door holding a rifle. Dash camera footage shows Fierros open the truck’s driver side door. Fierr os appears to jump back as though startled and opens fire. Fierros and Rojas backpedal and continue to fire into the truck as Conger fires from the passenger side. By this point, the traffic light has turned green and surrounding traffic has driven away. T he truck slowly rolls forward several car lengths and collides with a traffic pole. Holder suffered 11 gunshot wounds and, at 10:14 a.m., was pronounced dead at the scene. Fierros stated to investigators that he fired at Holder after he opened the driver d oor and saw Holder pointing a pistol at him. Conger stated that he approached the passenger door, saw Holder pointing a pistol at Fierros, and opened fire in response. Rojas did not provide a voluntary statement. Deputy Jose Pimentel arrived moments after the incident. He stated to investigators that he observed Holder unconscious inside the truck, slumped across the driver and passenger seats. Pimentel saw what he perceived to be a pistol lying next to Holder’s right arm, in the space between the seats. Pi mentel removed the item —a metallic pistol -shaped torch lighter with apparent blood on it —and placed it on the ground underneath the truck. Figure 1: Photo of pistol -shaped lighter that Pimentel removed from the truck cabin. 2 FACTUAL AN ALYSIS Video Conger’s Dashcam Conger equipped his patrol car with his own non -LASD dash camera. It captured portions of the incident. There is no audio. The footage begins during the traffic stop. Conger’s patrol car is seen directly behind the box truck, which is parked along a curb c lose to a four way stop, in a residential neighborhood of single family houses. After several minutes, the truck abruptly starts and rapidly drives away. Conger and three other patrol cars give chase at a high rate of speed for about one city block, until the truck is forced to a stop in heavy traffic, at a red light at Piuma Avenue and Alondra Boulevard. Fierros’ patrol car is first in line behind the now -idle truck, followed by Conger’s. Fierros exits his car pointing his service pistol at the truck as Co nger exits his car and walks into view armed with a rifle. Rojas appears shortly after with her service pistol drawn. Fierros and Rojas approach the driver side of the truck as Conger approaches the passenger side. Figure 2: Dashcam still showing the thr ee involved deputies moments after the box truck stops at the red light. 3 Figure 3: Dashcam still showing deputies approach the truck. Fierros reaches the driver door, opens it, and jumps back as if startled and appears to open fir e immediately, as do Rojas and Conger. The three deputies fire their weapons and back pedal away from the truck. It is not clear from the footage whether Fierros or Conger is the first to fire. Meanwhile, the traffic light at Alondra Boulevard turns green and surrounding traffic proceeds forward. A few moments later, the truck slowly rolls forward with the deputies jogging alongside it, until the truck appears to collide into something and comes to a stop several car lengths closer to Alondra Boulevard. The deputies approach the driver and passenger sides of the truck again but are now largely out of view of the camera, which is blocked by Fierros’ patrol car in the foreground. 4 Figure 4: Dashcam still showing Fierros open the truck door. (Rojas is out of view, to Fierros’ right.) Figure 5: Dashcam still showing the moment that Fierros shoots, after opening the truck door and jumping back, apparently startled. Rojas is out of view, standing to his right. Deputy Chavez runs toward the box truck and appears to flinch in response to the gunfire. 5 Chavez Cell Phone Video Investigators recovered video footage of the incident apparently captured by someone driving by and uploaded onto the internet. The footage begins after the box truck was rolling forward. Fierros and Rojas are seen jogging after the truck as it rolls. Fier ros fires one shot into the driver side of the cabin. The truck’s front driver side wheel jumps a raised concrete center median and slowly crashes into a traffic pole. Fierros jogs up to the rolling truck and opens the driver door. He points his pistol int o the driver side of the cabin, holding the door open and walking along with the truck until it crashes to a stop and the video ends. The sound of Fierros’ gunshot can be heard in the video. The deputies’ commands, or communication from Holder, if any, can not be heard. Figure 6: Cell video still showing Fierros fire his weapon. 6 Figure 7: Cell video still showing Fierros holding the driver door open just before the truck crashed. Body Worn Video The deputies present during the inciden t, including the involved deputies, were not equipped with BWV. Three sergeants, who responded afterward, were equipped with BWV and recorded footage that shows the deputies attempting to remove Holder from the truck and render medical aid. The footage als o shows Deputy Pimentel apparently recover the torch lighter from the cabin and place it on the ground underneath the truck. The view, however, is obstructed —shot from behind the deputy —and does not show where in the cabin the torch lighter was located. Autopsy Holder was pronounced dead at the scene, at 10:14 a.m., by fire department personnel. An autopsy was performed by Doctor Joseph Vallone of the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office. Doctor Vollone ascribed the cause of death to gunshot wounds. Holde r suffered 11 gunshot wounds, detailed as follows, in no particular order: (1) entry wound to the right chin; (2) through and through wound to the left forearm; (3) entry wound to the left upper chest; (4) graze wound to the left shoulder; (5) entry wound to the front right forearm; (6) entry wound to the right upper lateral chest, travelling back to front; (7) entry wound to the right upper lateral chest; (8, 9, and 11) entry wounds to the rear right arm; and (10) graze wound to the front right arm. Toxico logy testing revealed the presence of cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine in Holder’s blood. 7 Firearms Evidence After the incident, Conger’s duty .223 rifle contained one round in the chamber plus seven rounds in an attached magazine that, Con ger stated, contained 18 rounds before the incident. Deputy Fierros’ duty 9mm pistol contained one round in the chamber plus 15 rounds in an attached 17 round capacity magazine. Fierros stated that he emptied one full magazine during the incident and reloa ded. Deputy Rojas’s duty 9mm pistol contained one round in the chamber plus 13 rounds in an attached 17 round capacity magazine. Based upon this, Conger likely fired ten to 11 rounds, Fierros likely fired 19 to 20 rounds, and Rojas likely fired three to fo ur rounds. Civilian Witnesses Investigators interviewed two motorists who were stopped at the red light when the incident occurred. The first stated that he saw deputies with guns approach the truck. He could not see the driver. He heard the deputies yelli ng unintelligible words, followed by several gunshots, causing him to duck down in his car until the shooting stopped. He did not see what caused the deputies to fire. The second motorist gave a similar account. He heard the deputies yelling “Stop!” severa l times before the shooting started. He also did not see what caused the gunfire. Deputy Statements Christopher Conger Deputy Conger gave the following voluntary statement. Conger was on duty near Alondra Boulevard and Studebaker Road with his partner, De puty Steven Douma, who was in a separate patrol car. Conger heard over the radio that an LAPD airship was nearby pursuing a reckless driver (later identified as Holder) in a Ford box truck. Conger and Douma located the truck in a nearby neighborhood. Douma radioed to Conger that he was going to initiate a felony traffic stop. Douma activated his lights and sirens and the truck stopped. For “several minutes,” Conger and Douma, now joined by Deputy Villalobos, commanded Holder to exit the truck with his hands up. Holder ignored them and sped away on Piuma Avenue at a high rate of speed, at one point driving on the wrong side of the road. A short distance later, the truck was forced to a stop due to “heavy traffic” at a red light. The truck was five to six cars from the intersection. While the truck was stuck at the red light, the deputies formed a plan to remove Holder from the truck. Conger approached on the passenger side while Fierros and Rojas approached the driver side. Fierros yelled several times for Hol der to show his hands. When Conger was within three feet of the passenger door, he saw Holder “sitting in the driver’s seat. He was looking to his left —over his left shoulder out the driver’s side window, and he was holding his right hand up against his chest holding what I believe[d] to be a small pistol. It was silver colored and metallic, and the way he was holding it [pointed toward the driver door] I believed he was about to ambush my partners who were coming up on the driver’s side door.” Seeing this, Conger yelled, “Gun! Gun! Gun!” and fired ten rounds at Holder. He heard the sound of gunshots from the driver side of the truck. Holder “slump[ed] over to the right ... the truck began moving slow.” The truck slowly rolled several car lengths and crashed into a “large pillar” in the center median, which 8 divided the two lanes of traffic on Piuma Avenue. Deputies initially attempted to remove him from the cabin to render aid, but, seeing that he appeared deceased, discontinued those efforts and left him inside. Conger did not see Pimentel recover the torch lighter. Javier Fierros Fierros’ patrol car was the first unit behind the truck when it stopped at the red light. Fierros gave several “call outs” to the driver to exit the truck. He yelled for him to roll down his window. Fierros could not see the driver. He, Conger, and Rojas d ecided they would approach the truck to prevent it from driving away. As Fierros approached the driver door, he yelled for Holder to put his hands on the steering wheel. The window was rolled up. He could not see Holder until he was “right up close.” Holde r stared at him through the driver side window. He was visible only from the neck up because of the height of the truck. They made eye contact. Holder had a “blank stare.” Fierros thought he looked like he was under the influence “of something.” Holder sai d nothing. Fierros described what happened next: “I opened the door with my left hand and the first thing I saw was a – a firearm pointed right at me ... basically, like a foot away.” Fierros stated that Holder held the firearm across his chest with his ri ght hand, pointing it at Fierros. Fierros “backpedaled” and fired at Holder until his weapon was empty. He reloaded his weapon. He heard “other rounds” and thought Holder might be shooting at him. The driver door was “flapping” open and closed, obscuring h is view of Holder. Fierros could not tell yet whether he had disabled Holder. Still seeing “a lot of movement” inside the cabin and not able to see Holder’s hands or whether he still held the gun, Fierros fired “a few more rounds.” Fierros estimated that h e fired 19 times in total. Fierros approached the truck as it slowly rolled. He opened the driver door. He saw Holder lying across the driver and passenger seats. Near Holder, in “the middle” of the cabin, lay the “firearm.” Fierros believes he was present when Pimentel removed the item from the truck. Jose Pimentel Deputy Pimentel gave the following statement. He arrived after the incident and saw Conger and Rojas “detaining” Holder at gunpoint with the driver side door open. Holder lay across the seats, slumped over. Conger told Pimentel that the “gun” was near the driver’s right arm. Pimentel stepped into the cabin. He saw Holder’s right arm hanging down in the space between the seats. He saw what looked like the butt of a gun “right next to [Holder’s] ar m.” He realized, after picking up the item, that it was too light weight to be a gun. He removed it from the cabin and placed it on the roadway beneath the truck. The deputies briefly attempted to render aid to Holder but discontinued their efforts when it became apparent that Holder was deceased. 9 THE LAW A peace officer is justified in using deadly force when the officer reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, that such force is necessary for either of the follo wing reasons: (1) to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or toanother person; or (2) to apprehend a fleeing person for any felony that threatened or resulted indeath or serious bodily injury, if the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause deathor serious bodily injury to another unless immediately apprehended. Penal Code section835a(c)(1)(A) & (B).Deadly force shall be used “only when necessary in defense of human life,” and officers “shall use other available resources and techniques if reasonably safe and feasible to an objectively reasonable officer.” Penal Code section 835a(a)(2). “A threat of death or serious bodily injury is ‘imminent’ when, based on the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious bodily injury to the peace officer or another person. An imminent harm is not merely a fea r of future harm, no matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm, but is one that, from appearances, must be instantly confronted and addressed.” Penal Code section 835a(e)(2). When considering the totality of the circumstances, all facts known to or perceived by the peace officer at the time, including the conduct of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of deadly force, are taken into consideration. Penal Code secti on 835a(a)(4) & (e)(3). The peace officer’s decision to use force is not evaluated with the benefit of hindsight and shall account for occasions when officers may be forced to make quick judgments about using force. Penal Code section 835a(a)(4). Moreover, “[a] peace officer who makes or attempts to make an arrest need not retreat, or desist from their efforts by reason of the resistance or threatened resistance of the person being arrested.” Penal Code section 835a(d). ANALYSIS The involved deputies receiv ed a report of a reckless driver (later identified as Holder) in a box truck. Conger and his partner initially attempted a felony traffic stop of the truck. For several minutes, they commanded Holder to exit the truck and surrender. Holder ignored them and drove away at high speed through a residential neighborhood. Deputies Conger, Fierros, and Rojas caught up to the truck one block later when it was forced to a stop by traffic at a red light. The three deputies decided that they would attempt to remove Ho lder from the truck while it was stopped, to prevent further reckless driving. The deputies approached the truck from behind. Its doors and windows were shut. Their path of approach and the truck’s elevated ride height largely concealed Holder. 10 Fierros stated that he could see Holder only from the neck up. Holder stared “blankly” at him. Fierros opened the driver door and was startled to see that Holder was pointing at him what appeared to be a firearm from a distance of one foot. H older held the object across his chest with his right hand. Fierros stated that he could not see Holder’s hands, or anything below his neck, prior to opening the door. Fierros immediately responded by firing his pistol at Holder until it was empty. Fierros reloaded and heard other gunshots but did not know who was firing. He stated that he continued to see movement inside the truck and did not know if Holder was injured. He could not see whether Holder still held the gun because the truck’s door was swingin g open and shut as the truck rolled forward. Fierros fired at least one more round, until, he stated, he could tell that Holder was disabled. Conger gave a similar account. In particular, Conger stated that he saw Holder facing toward Fierros and pointing at him what appeared to be a firearm, holding it across his chest with his right hand. Rojas did not provide a voluntary statement, but video footage shows that she was right next to Fierros when he began firing. The footage appears to show her discharge h er duty weapon a moment later. Fierros’ and Conger’s statements are corroborated, first, in their similarity; second, by Conger’s dash cam footage; and third, by the torch lighter recovered from the truck cabin. In their statements to investigators, Fierro s and Conger gave identical descriptions of what Holder did with the torch lighter —held across his chest in his right hand, pointing at Fierros. Moreover, the video footage shows Conger open the driver side door and jump back as if startled and immediately open fire. Finally, moments after the incident, Deputy Pimentel arrived and retrieved a pistol -shaped torch lighter —metallic in appearance and covered in apparent blood — from the truck cabin, very close to Holder’s right arm. Body worn video appears to de pict Pimentel retrieve the torch lighter and place it on the ground underneath the truck, where investigators later photographed it. The evidence shows that Holder sat and waited in the truck pointing a gun -like object at the approaching deputies. He was c oncealed from view until Fierros opened the driver door (and for Conger, until he was within three feet of the passenger door). Holder thus appeared to be ambushing the deputies, and he forced a quick judgment about using force under circumstances that did not permit the use of less lethal resources. Considering the totality of the circumstances known to the deputies at the time, including those leading up to the incident, it was reasonable for the deputies to believe that deadly force was necessary to defe nd against an imminent deadly threat. The deputies acted reasonably based on the facts perceived by them at the time, and this conclusion is not altered by the hindsight knowledge that Holder possessed a pistol -shaped torch lighter, not a firearm. 11 CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, we find that Deputies Conger, Fierros, and Rojas acted lawfully in self -defense and defense of a third party when they used deadly force against Frederick Holder. 12"

File #016 -00029 -3199 -064'],"The evidence examined i n this investigation shows that on the morning of March 15, 2016, Be , Br s, Ca , and Ja targeted Sanche z’s house to burglarize. Be and Br pried open a kitchen window, and forced their way into Sanchez’s house, as Ca remained outside as a look -out while Ja waited nearby acting as the get away driver . Unbeknownst to the group , Sanchez was sleeping alone in a bedroom inside the residence, and was awaken ed by the sound of Be and Br inside his residence. Startled and understandably in fear for his s afety, Sanchez armed himself with a handgun he kept in his bedroom and carefully walked outside his bedroom, suspecting an intruder or intruders had entered his home. Sanchez’s suspicions were confirmed when he encountered Be and Br , who were hea vily clothed, inside his li ving room. Fearing Be and Br were armed, and that 25 The court in Gilmore found that undisputed facts established that the defendant did in fact entertain the belief that he was so threatened and that his belief was reasonable where the defendant was in his home asleep, was awoken to scraping noises at his window, became “absolutely frantic” when he encountered an intruder attempting to re move a window screen to enter his residence, and shot the intruder, killing him. 15 there were addition al subjects in side, Sanchez ordered the m to stop, at gunpoint, and told the m he had a gun.26 It was clear to Sanchez that a felony burglary h ad been c ommitted by the two subjects , because they had forced their way into Sanchez’s previously secured home without his permission. Undeterred by Sanchez’s actions and orders to stop, Be and Br fled . The evidence shows that at the time Be and Br fled , they were fleeing felons, who had just committed a residential burglary of Sanchez’s residence, and that Sanchez was lawfully attempting to detain them. As in Gilmore , the character and manner of this burglary arguably warranted deadly force to detain the perpetrators. As in Gilmore , Sanchez was alone inside his residence when confronted by not one, but two intruders, Be and Br . Further, Sanchez had reasonable grounds to believe that Be and Br may hav e armed themselves with the gun Sanchez kept in plain sight in the truck , which was unlocked and parked in the attached garage , and the service weapon in the duty belt Sanchez kept by the back door. The evidence shows that these weapons were loc ated in areas within the residence in close proximity to where Be and Br were when confronted by Sanchez . Sanchez also noted that the door to the attached garage had been opened, further giving him re asonable suspicion that the two subjects may h ave accessed the gun within the truc k. Be and Br were also heavily clothed, making it more difficult for Sanchez to determine if they were armed. According to Sanchez, as Be and Br fled, one of them, whom Sanchez identified as Be – the same subject he later confronted in his driveway, appeared to reach into his waistband.27 Based on Sanchez’s training and experience , he reasonably feared this subject was reaching for a gun, prompting Sanchez to fire his handg un three times in sel f-defense. Although, Br denied reaching into his waistband and denied anyone was in possessi on of any weapons, Sanchez’s beliefs were not unreasonable given his training and experience, and the circumstances confronting him. Further, although Sanchez only described Be reaching for his waistband, it cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that his shooting of Br was unlawful, since both he and Be were fleeing at the same time and were in the same general area. Br was likely wounded at the time Sanchez was firing at Be . Although Be , Br , and Ca stated they were only attempting to flee at the time of the shooting, ultimately, it cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Sanchez’ s use of deadly force in defending hims elf within his residence was unlawful. This is particularly so in light of the fact that Sanchez is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril or death or great bodily injury to himself when he used deadly force against Be and Br , who had unlawfully and forcefully entered his residence.28 In view of the presumption weighing in Sanchez’s favor, it cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Sanchez did not have a reasonable fear of imminent death or injury to himse lf when he used deadly force against Be and Br . 26 Sanchez stated that the door to his attached garage was opened and added, “I didn’t know if they had been in there, or if someone was still in there.” 27 According to Sanchez’s initial public safety statement, he fired t wo to three rounds at Be who was on his “outside ” patio heading north, and who quickly turned and appeared to reach toward his front waistband. The ballistics evidence and bullet impa ct on the east cinder block wall, appears to corroborate Sanchez’s account, that Be and Br were , in fact, outside the residence when he fired. 28 It bears noting that both Be and Br stated they were unsure about whether they were still inside Sanchez’s house at the time they were shot. And, Ca stated that Be and Br “were inside the house when the shots went off [emphasis added] .” Further, Br sustained a gunshot wound to his abdom en, indicating he was facing Sanchez at the time he was shot , and not runnin g away from Sanchez. 16 Notably, Sanchez’s acco unt and the ballistics evidence suggesting Be and Br were out side when the shots were fired contravene Ca , Be , and Br ’ accounts suggesting that they were inside when the shots were fired. Nonetheless, whether Be and Br were inside or outside Sanchez’s residence when the shots were fired, the end result would be the same - as either way, there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Sanchez acted unlawfully when he used deadly force against Be and Br . In fact, it can be reasonably said that Ca , Be , and Br ’ own accounts weigh slig htly more in Sanchez’s favor, since if Be and Br were inside the residence when Sanchez fired, then Sanchez would certainly be entitled to the presumption that he reasonably feared imminent peril or death or great bodily injury when he used deadly force in defending himself within his residence. Ultimately, with or without the benefit of the presumption, it cannot be said beyond a reasonable doubt that Sanchez’s fear of imminent death or bodily harm and use of deadly force was unreasonable given t he totality of the circumstances. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Lieutenant Joseph Sanchez acted unlawfully under the circumstances. We are therefore closing our file and will take no further action in this matter."

He had two letters, one dated April 23, 2021, and April 24, 2021. In his letters addressed to Shooter McGavin, S olitro planned the details and memorialized the moment he would be shot . Solitro’s plan began when he intentionally attacked the officers by ramming his car into the ir patrol car. The impact was violent and re sulted in injury to Officer Kim. Before the officers could evaluate whether they were injured by the impact, Solitro immediately jumped out of his car and simula ted holding a concealed weapon behind his back . His physical actions and his announc ement that he was going to shoot the office rs, was justifiably perceived by both officers and witnesses as an immediate and deadly threat. Officer Kim described Solitro ’s demeanor as “extremely mad, extremely angry, almost accusatory” and Solitro’s physical actions as threatening “I believed [Solitro] was pulling out a pistol . . . aiming a gun, and . . . point [ing] it directly at my partner.” Solitro was aware of threat he presented to the officers because he had played out a similar scenario in a prior confrontation with an officer involving lethal force in Rhode Island. In this case, when Solitro began his countdown and moved towards the officers, he intentionally created a sense of urgency that eliminated any opportunity to deescalate the situation and avoid a lethal response. 15 Therefore, based on the totality of the circumstances, it was reasonable for Officer Pal to believe that Solitro was holding a deadly weapon and deadly force was necessary to defend against an imminent threat of death For the foregoing reasons, we find that Officer Pal’s use of deadly force was reasonable under the circumstances and he acted lawfully in self -defense and in defense of others."

File #017 -125632131013'],"The evidence examined shows that Rothrock formed the opinion that the PT Cruiser was stolen because Lewis looked surprised when he noticed the deputies and fled, leaving the driver’s side door open. Thus, Rothrock was acting on reasonable suspicion when he attempted to detain Lewis. Rothrock was also acting within reason when he ordered Lewis to stop running and show his hands for officer safety. An independen t witness saw that Lewis did not comply with Rothrock’s commands to show his hands and he believed Lewis was holding an object in his pants. The surveillance video shows Lewis fleeing from Rothrock, failing to comply with any commands to stop, lie down, or show his hands, and pausing as he ran along the path and twisting his torso as if to look behind him. These movements are also consistent with Rothrock’s statements that he believed Lewis was armed, that he believed he saw the gun wrapped in a rag in Le wis’ hand, that Lewis turned towards him, and that Lewis did not stay on the ground after dropping down the first time. After Lewis turned and dropped again, he rolled towards Rothrock and Rothrock perceived that Lewis was lifting the hand that he believe d held the gun. As was later determined, the gun and the rag were already on the ground to the east and south of Lewis’ feet. Rothrock did not recount the second time Lewis dropped to the ground, when —as visible on the surveillance footage —he left an ite m behind before jumping and dropping again. Based on the available evidence, it appears that Rothrock had turned to take cover between the cars in the parking lot at that moment. Lewis was off camera when he received the fatal shots to his abdomen. The re is no video evidence to contradict Rothrock’s statements that Lewis rolled onto his side and raised his right hand. The autopsy findings support the inference that Lewis was not lying on his stomach at the time the fatal shots were fired. Rothrock sta ted that he believed that the gun was in Lewis’ right hand as he rolled over and lifted his hand towards him. The burden would be on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this belief was not only unreasonable but also not honest. 20 Under t he circumstances, there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that that Rothrock did not reasonably believe that Lewis posed a threat of serious bodily harm or death and found it necessary to respond with deadly force."

File #019 -16422 -0294 -057'],"The evidence examined shows that there was a firearm in the Mountaineer when the deputies contacted Evangelista in the parking lot. Evangelista admitted having a black handgun in the center console, however denie d removing it in the deputies’ presence. Sanchez and Calderon stated that they observed Evangelista lift a black handgun in his right hand after reaching around the floorboard area. The fact that the deputies were aware of the black handgun contradicts Evangelista’s assertion that it remained out of view in the center console. Additionally, Jorge Z. saw Evangelista reaching into his right waistband , escalat ing the deputies’ response during the encounter . Jorge Z.’s observations corroborate the deputies’ statement that Evangelista was making reaching movements to his right . It also tends to impeach Evangelista’s claim that he was unaware that Sanchez and Calderon were deputies until he was fleeing the parking lot. Jorge Z. recognized Sanchez and Calderon as deputies as soon as the y pulled into the lot. After ignoring multiple c ommands to stop reaching and show his hands, Evangelista lifted a handgun in his right hand. A reasonable person in Sanchez and Calderon’s circumstances would be in fear of imminent death or great bodily injury. Evangelista did not immediately flee in hi s vehicle from the deputies. Instead, h e made a continued effort to search for and take possession of the gun. It was reasonable for Calderon to believe that Evangelista armed himself in order to shoot at him. Additionally, Sanchez heard Calderon yell, “Oh, fuck!” after Evangelista began to drive away and after hearing gunfire. Sanchez reasonably believe d that Evangelista had shot Calderon, or struck him with the vehicle, in an attempt to assist Jorge Z. to e scape. The deputies were forc ed to react in 8 an instant to events quickly unfolding in front of them and they responded with reasonable deadly force. Evangelista sustained lacerations and scratches to his right forearm. Although the evidence s trongly suggests that the injuries were su stained while Evangelista jumped fences during his escape, the possibility of a grazing gunshot wound cannot be eliminated. We conclude that Deputy Joel Calderon acted in lawful self -defense, and Deputy Juan Sanchez acted in lawful defense of others when they used deadly force against Robert Evangelista .

File #F0 48-17'],"The evidence in this case show s that , before Escobar, Lopez and Pineda discharged their service weapons, Trevino pointed a loaded revolver at the officers while advancing in their direction. The officers had previously ordered Trevino to drop the gun and not point the weapon toward them nearl y fifty times . Trevino’s next -door neighbor observed Trevino waving the revolver on the balcony minutes before the shooting and had warned him that he would be shot . 17 Additionally, t he officers, neighbor and DICVS indicate that Trevino was suicidal and had threatened to shoot himself. The law allows police officers to use deadly force when they reasonably believe that someone is trying to shoot them. Trevino’s actions demonstrate that he was unwilling to drop the gun and surrender and advanced toward the officers with the revolver. In response to Escobar’s last command to drop t he gun or he would be shot, Trevino replied , “No , I’m not ,” then pointed the gun at the officers . Under the circumstances, it was reasonable for the officers to believe that Trevino was a bout to shoot them. Furthermore, when Trevino attempted to regain possession of the gun after dropping it, it was reasonable for Lopez and Pineda to believe they would be in imminent danger if he recovered the loaded firearm. The officers responded with reasonable deadly force. The second shooting occurred when Trevino reemerged on the balcony approximately 11 seconds after the first shooting began. Seven of the o fficers on the street discharged their weapons at Trevino when it appeared to them that Trevino was going to fire his weapon at them from above. Castro believed that Trevino was actually firing rounds , while Nunez believed he was about to shoot at the officers inside the apartment. The evidence shows that Trevino was no longer armed at that time. His revolv er was recovered on the living room floor where Lopez and Pineda saw him drop it before he ran back onto the balcony. In analyzing these officers’ conduct, the question is whether the officers’ actions were reasonable based on the circumstances confronti ng them at the time. Prior to the officer involved shootings, Zizzo, Gone, Gundell, Nunez, Castro and Rivera had seen Trevino holding the revolver on the balcony. Torres suspected Trevino was holding a gun due to his behavior and the “man with a gun ” call. In addition, Torres heard fellow officers ordering Trevino to drop the gun. Trevino ignored repeated orders to drop the weapon and went back into the apartment while still armed . All of the involved officers, with the exception of Castro, heard and/or saw multiple gunshots , during the first officer involved shooting, coming from the apartment shortly after Trevino entered with the firearm. Perkins and Norat heard the gunfire, but had not previously s een Trevino on the balcony. Based on the information they had at the time, it was reasonable for the officers to believe that Trevino was actively shooting people in the a partment or the officers on the fourth floor . In addition, several officers observe d wood flying in their direction leading them to believe that Trevino was shooting at them through the wooden balcony during the first round of gunfire. After the first shooting , Trevino reemerged onto the balcony unarmed . However, Zizzo, Nunez and Torres observed Trevino take a shooting stance leading them to reasonably conclude that he was still in possession of the gun and about to fire upon the officers. Gone, Gundell, Perkins, Norat and Rivera saw Trevino raise and point what appeared to them to be a gun, in their direction. Castro believed Trevino was actively firing a weapon at the officers. Although Trevino was no longer in possession of the revolver, the re is evidence to support the conclusion that Trevino was holding an object that he used to s imulate a firearm. Immediately after the second shooting, Gone, Gundell and Norat observed Trevino drop what they believed to be the gun as he hung over the eastern side of the balcony. Nunez saw an object fall from Trevino, but was unable to identify it. Gone advised fellow officers that Trevino had 18 dropped the gun , which was captured on the DICVS. On the walkway below the eastern side of the balcony, a butane torch lighter , with a shape similar to a gun, w as recovered. It would be reasonable for the officers to mistake the torch for a gun when it was pointed at them in a manner consistent with a firearm and they had seen Trevino holding a gun moments earlier . It is also possible that the object that Trevino dropped was the cellphone recovered in the nearby planter. It sustained bullet damage and was likely near Trevino during the shooting. It should be noted that officers observed Trevino either tak e a shooting stance or point what they believed to be a firearm in their direction before the officers fired . If the object in Trevino’ s hand was the cellphone or butane torch , it is reaso nable to conclude , based upon his actions , that Trevino intended for the officers to believe he was still in possession of a gun. The tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving circumstances that faced the officers standing on the street below the fourth -floor balcony and apartment are consistent with the situation s envisioned by the United States Supreme Court in Graham . When Trevino reemerged onto the balc ony immediately after the initial gunfire, taking a shooting stance and pointing what appeared to be a firearm in their direction, the officers were forced to make a split -second judgment . Under the circumstances it was reasonable to conclude that Trevino posed a significant threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officers and they responded with reasonable deadly force. We conclude that Officers Nestor Escobar, Xiuhnenetl Lopez, Alejandro Pineda, Brenda Castro, Victor Gone, Jonathan Gundell , Jeffri Norat, Lance Perkins, Jose Rivera, Abel Torres, and Thomas Zizzo acted in lawful self -defense and defense of others, and Officer Miguel Nunez acted in lawful defense of others when they used deadly force against Santino Trevino.

File #01 8-00027 -3199 -013']","The evidence examined shows that Robb ins was in the performance of his duties w hen attempting to apprehend Ross for an assault with a deadly weapon that had just occurred . Robbins stated that he fired two rounds from his rifle because he believed Ross was drawing a gun in order to shoot him. The question in this case is whether a r easonable person , in possession of the facts known to Robbins at the time of the shooting , would believe that Ross posed a threat of serious physical harm or death and find it necessary to respond with deadly force. Robbins was advised that someone had fired up to 20 rounds outside the businesses at 12812 Van Ness Avenue . The information described only one shooter. The subsequent investigation and ballistic evidence show that there were two shooters. However, for the purposes of this analysis, the onl y relevant information was the information known to Robbins at the time of the shooting . Ross was running from Colon’s marked police vehicle when Robbins first observed him . Ross matched the physical and clothing description of the suspect. Ross fled from Medeiros through the parking lot. Robbins noticed that Ross held his left hand at his waist as if he was pinning a gun or heavy object to his left side. His right arm, however, was moving in a typical running fashion . Colon and Medeiros also observ ed the odd manner that Ross held his left hand. The lack of movement by Ross’ left arm was captured on Medeiros ’ body worn camera footage . Under the circumstances, i t was reasonable for Robbins to believe that Ross was holding a firearm at his left side. Ross matched the shooting suspect ’s description, he was running from officers less than a half mile from the shooting scene and within minutes of the shooting . The evidence shows that Ross was, in fact, carrying a loaded 9mm semiautomatic firearm in his left short’s pocket. The footage captured on Medeiros’ body worn camera shows Ross ’ left hand at his waist after he ran past the restroom s and electrical box. It captured Ross turning his head to the right, toward Robbins ’ position. It also captured Ross begin to turn his body, including his left arm, in the same direction before falling to the ground. The body worn camera footage corroborates Robbins’ observations. There is no evidence that Ross had any intention o f surrendering to the pursuing officers . Ross was fleeing the scene of a shooting w here he fired multiple rounds and was still armed with the 20 gun he used in that shooting. Ross ignored multiple orders to stop and show his hands. It reasonably appeared that Ross was attempting to escape in order to avoid the consequences of his criminal actions. The law does not require Robbins to wait and set eyes on t he gun before firing. If Ross moved or turned in a manner consistent with drawing a weapon while fleeing , given that Robbins had reason to believe Ross was armed, then Robbins had the right to protect himself . Under the circumstances, it was reasonable for Robbins to conclude that when Ross cocked his left arm toward him, Ross was drawing his gun to shoot at him, placing Robbins in reasonable fear of serious bodily harm or death . A reasonable argument could also be made that Ross was simply looking in Robbins’ direction to gauge his distance or to seek another avenue of escape. The burden rest s with the People to show beyond a reasonable doubt that an officer’s use of force was not justified under the circumstances. When two reasonable conclusions can be inferred from the same set of facts, you must choose the concl usion that points to innocenc e. Finally, police officers may use deadly force to capture a fleeing suspect who has committed a forcible and atrocious felony. The evidence shows that Robbins had probable cause to believe that Ross had committed a forcible an d atrocious cr ime that threatened death or serious bodily harm. Robbins reasonably believed that Ross was a n active shooter who had fired up to 20 rounds outside a business , injuring or killing an unknown number of victims, before fleeing into a neighborhood of homes, schools, churches and public parks on a weekday afternoon . We conclude that Officer Michael Robbins acted in lawful self-defense when he used deadly force against Kenneth Ross. We also conclude that Robbins was justified in the use of deadly force to apprehend a dangerous fleeing felon . We are therefore closing our file and will take no further action in this ma tter."

DR#16 -57966'],"The evidence examined in this investigation shows that LBPD CCAT detectives were engaged in an active investigation of a robbe ry/murder spree that had occurred fewer than twelve hours prior. Not far from the scenes of those crimes, the CCAT team encountered individuals and 11 vehicles matching the descriptions of the armed robbers. The driver of the victim’s Audi had the same hair style as a member of the group pawning the victims’ stolen items. Upon the approach of the CCAT unmarked vehicles, Hall immediately drove away recklessly, causing damage to other nearby vehicles. Mitchell and Thomas exited the car while it was moving and began to flee. Security camera video corroborates Anguiano’s observation that Thomas kept his right hand near his waistband as he made full strides towards the exit of the lot. Knowing that the weapons involved in the crime had not been recovered, Anguia no reasonably feared that Thomas could be reaching for a gun secured in his waistband to arm himself and evade arrest for a forcible and atrocious felony. Despite the obvious indicators that the police were ordering him to stop, Thomas accelerated away fr om the officers. Knowing that the lot was full of people and officers, and next to a dense residential neighborhood and park, it was reasonable for Anguiano to fear that Thomas would use deadly force to evade capture which could cause imminent and serious bodily harm to himself or others. Several officers and passersby also saw Mitchell jump from the moving car, dump his pizza boxes, disobey orders to stop, and run into traffic lanes on PCH to evade the police. Both Everts and Camrin were alarmed to see h im pulling on his waistband. Just as in the above -analysis, it was reasonable for them to fear that Mitchell could arm himself, resulting in serious bodily injury to other officers or nearby residents. Indeed, he was so desperate to flee that he entered a residence and sought to conceal his identity by changing his clothes. Similarly, Hall drove away recklessly, crashed the Audi, and then seemed to take evasive action, reaching for his waistband and ignoring orders to stop, as he fled on foot towards a re sidential area. The officers’ reasonable beliefs that Thomas, Mitchell, and Hall posed imminent threats to them or to others warranted the use of lethal force to stop the threat. The fact that it was later determined that these individuals were unarmed wh en they exited the Audi does not change this result, because it was reasonable under the circumstances for Anguiano, Brown, and Everts to believe they were actually armed and dangerous. Additionally , the shooting of Thomas and Hall, and the striking of Mit chell, were lawful because the facts and circumstances known to the officers at the moment they used deadly force or drove their vehicle gave them probable cause to believe these men had committed or aided the robbery and murder of multiple victims – a forcible and atrocious crime – and that they were still armed while he was trying to flee. Those facts, in conjunction with their apparent ability to escape into nearby residences, would lead a reasonable person to believe it was necessary to use deadly forc e to take either of these individuals into custody. Therefore, the shooting by Anguiano and Brown, and the use of force by Everts were lawful. We conclude that Detectives Anguiano, Brown, and Everts used lawful and reasonab le force in self-defense, or de fense of others. We further conclude that they used lawful force in the apprehension of Mitchell, Hall, and Thomas , who they reasonably believed had been part of a robbery -murder spree, were armed, and were attempting to escape arrest.

Based on the totality of the circumstances, Thompson’s actions could reasonably be interpreted by a reasonable deputy as threatening even though, in hindsight, Thompson’s actions were not life-threatening. Ponsford’s conduct and voluntary statement indicated he actually believed Thompson was an armed suspect who presented a deadly threat , and the evidence is consistent with that belief being reasonable. The circumstances immediately prior to, and during the sh ooting, put Ponsford in a situation in which he was required to make a split -second judgment. Ponsford’s 28 fear of Thompson was understandable and justified given that he believed he was dealing with an armed suspect who had tried to kill deputies a short t ime earlier, and as one of the “overwatch” deputies it was his duty to protect himself and the deputies around him from being shot. There is no evidence to suggest that Ponsford did not honestly and reasonably believe that Thompson was an armed suspect wh o presented a deadly threat when he fired his service weapon to protect himself and others. In sum, w hat transpired in this incident was a tragic series of events put in motion by Alexander and his dangerous and violent actions . A reasonable trier of fact is likely to find that Alexander put Ponsford and the other deputies in a situation that caused them to make a split -second decision regarding the amount of force to use in defending themselves , and the public, from a perceived arm ed attacker. The fact that Ponsford’s actions were based on the mistaken fact that Thompson was the armed suspect does little to assuage the emotional response to such a tragedy. Nonetheless, this office is guided by the legal principles discussed in thi s memorandum. Based on the totality of the circumstances in this incident, there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Deputy Ponsford did not act in self -defense and /or in the defense of others ."

D. File #F0 96-11'],"The evidence examined shows that Semaj B. and Butler were involved in a physical fight over money. Butler thr ew the first punch, striking Semaj B. in the face. Semaj B. fought back and ultimately broke Butler’s jaw. Butler left the location and returned a short time later with a loaded firearm. Butler fired multiple rounds at Semaj B. through the front security gate of his apartment. Butler entered the apartment in an a pparent attempt to kill Semaj B. In addition to Semaj B., there were three women and six children in the apartment. 10 Perkins and Sanchez were the first officers to arrive to the scene. They were advised that Butler was armed and still inside the apartment, along with an unknown number of children. Perkins and Sanchez entered the apartment once additional units arrived to the location. Upon entering the bedroom, a teenage girl in the closet pointed to the open rear bedroom door and said that someone had a gun. When Perkins stepped outside the rear door, Semaj B. stood up and ran inside the bedroom. Butler was lying on his back on the ground and pointed a gun directly at Perkins. Butler’s actions placed Perkins in reasonable fear of imminent serious bodily injury or death, and he responded with reasonable deadly force. Sanchez m istakenly believed that Semaj B. was the shooting suspect when Semaj B. ran inside the bedroom from the rear yard. The question is whether under the circumstances it was reasonable for Sanchez to believe that he, or another person, was in imminent danger of being killed or suffering great bodily injury . When Sanchez entered th e bedroom behind Perkins , Sanchez’ attention was d rawn to a child in the closet. At that time, he hea rd three gunshots in close proximity to him. Sanchez turned toward the rear door and no longer saw Perkins in the bedroom. At the same time, Semaj B. ran screaming through the rea r door. Under the circumstances, i t was reasonable for Sanchez to believe that Semaj B. was the shooting suspect and had just shot his partner. It was also reasonable for Sanchez to believe that after shooting Perkins, Semaj B. was attempting to escape from the police and still armed with the gun. Semaj B. ignored Sanchez’ orders to stop and continued toward him . His right hand was not visible and it appeared to Sanchez that Semaj B. was about to extend his right arm as if he were aiming a firearm. As the United States Supreme Court observ ed in Graham , officers are often forced to make spli t-second judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving. The use of deadly force should not be analyzed using the luxury of hindsight, but rather through the lens of a reasonable person at the scene. Under the circumstances, i t was reasonable for Sanchez to believe that Semaj B. posed an imminent threat of danger to himself, and the child hiding in the closet , when he ran toward him in the confined space of the bedroom . Sanchez responded with reasonable deadly force . It was subsequently determined that Semaj B. was not armed when he came through the rear door. However, the law states that as long as a person’s belief in the need to use deadly force in self -defense was reasonable, the danger does not have to actually exist. We conclude that Officer Lance Perkins acted in lawful self -defense against Butler , and Officer David Sanchez acted in lawful self-defense and defense of others against Semaj B. , when they used deadly force. We are therefore closing our file and will take no further action in this matter."

The report also found that Burke, Rodriguez, Bender, Stea, Florez and Fillinger’s actions were “not proportional, objectively reasonable, or necessary.” These a dministrative findings have a burden of proof of preponderance of eviden ce, whereas a criminal case has the burden of pro of of beyond a reasonable doubt. The internal review report opined that Burke, as supervisor, should have been more focused on supervising and not firing his weapon, and that he should have assigned roles t o other officers that would not have requi red firing his weapon. None of the tactical errors raised in the LAPD’s evaluation change the conclusions that each of the officers acted objectively reasonably when observing the threat from Torres as he lifted his firearm in a manner that appeared calculated to shoot at officers. Each of the shooting officers had an objectively reason able basis to believe that Torres constituted a deadly threat when he began to raise his firearm which required the use of deadly force to repel that threat."

File #19-27010', 'L.A.S.D. File #019 -00081-3199 -013']","The evidence in this case shows that at the time of shooting, officers were pursuing Fisher, 11 minutes after he and Morris had committed an armed robbery of a jewelry store. Under the law, an officer may use deadly force to apprehend an individual where there is reasonable cause to believe that person has committed a forcible and atrocious crime. People v. Ceballos (1974) 12 Cal. 3d 470, 478, states that p ursuant to Penal Code section 197, robbery is considered a forcible or atrocious felony because human life either is, or is presumed to b e, in peril. Furthermore, the evidence shows that Tso fired his weapon when he believed Fisher had removed a gun from his waistband area and was about to fire upon him, and his fellow officers. Fisher, however, was not armed with a gun. Instead, he was in possession of a black cellphone. The People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable person in Tso’s position would find it un reasonable for Tso to believe Fisher armed himself with a gun and posed a threat of great bodily injury or death to the pursuing officers . Tso and the other officers were actively searching for two suspects from an armed robbery that occurred approximately 11 minutes earlier and in close p roximity to where they first observed Fisher . Fisher matched the description of one of the suspects and the evidence shows that he had, in fact, committed the robbery with Morris . The officers were aware that at least one of the suspects (Morris) used a gun during the robbery. It was unknown if Fisher was armed. It was not unreasonable for the officers to conclude that if one suspect was armed during the commission of the robbery , the other was also in possession of a gun . Due to 15 Fisher’s refusal to surrender , there was no t an opportunity to conclusively make that determination before the officer involved shooting. The surveillance video corroborates the fact t hat Fisher walked away from the officers at a casual pace rather than ru n from the obvious police presence. Instead of complying with orders to get to the ground and show his hands, surveillance video shows Tso reaching his left hand into his jeans pocket. Prior to doing so, it appears that he was not holding anything in his hands. It is at this time that Hauck and Tso stated that they observed something in Fisher’s hands. After the shooting, surveillance video captured an object flying from the front of Fisher’s body. Tso stated he observed Fisher remove a black object wit h his left hand. The broken cellphone , surveillance video and Hauck and Crawford’s observations corroborate Tso. As the Thompson and Ryder courts stated, an officer is not required “to wait until he sets eyes upon the weapon before employing deadly force to protect himself against a fleeing suspect who turns and moves as though to draw a gun.” Requiring that a suspect actually have a weapon would place officers in “a dangerous and unreasonable situation … whether a particular seizure is reasonable i s dependent on the ‘totality of circumstances,’ and not simply on whether the suspect was actually armed.” Under the totality of circumstances, i t was not unreasonable for Tso to believe th e black object he observed Fisher remove from his clothing was a firearm and that Fisher intended to use against the officers in an effort to escape. We conclude that Officer Mykel Tso was justified in the use of deadly force to apprehend a dangerous and fleeing felon. We furth er conclude that there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable person in Tso’s position would find it unreasonable to believe that Fisher posed a threat of serious bodily harm or death."

Multiple rounds struck the patrol vehicle and Ingersoll sustained a grazing wound to the shoulder and shrapnel injuries to his right hand . Taylor’s actions placed Barajas and Ingersoll in imminent fear for their lives and they responded with reasonable deadly force when they returned fire with their service weapons . Tragically, Rickie Starks, an innocent bystander, was fatally wounded by gunfire during the pursuit. Based upon the coroner’s findings, Starks’ single gunshot wound to the chest was consistent with a round fi red from a large caliber, high-powered rifle . The Romarm/Cugir Draco fires 7.62 x 39mm rounds, consistent with bullet s fired from a high-powered rifle. Barajas and Ingersoll ’s service weapons fired a significantly smaller 9mm round.

When Glass turned towards them, having alr eady exhibited a wanton disregard for human life during the pursuit, multiple collisions and use of his vehicle as a deadly weapon towards both Smilor and Church, and having previously been observed with a firearm in his hand, it was not unreasonable for Ventura to believe Glass was still armed or arming himself with a handgun as he bent down. As such, the use of deadly force was also reasonable. Although not articulated by either deputy, each use of deadly force was also lawful to apprehend a fleeing fel on.
